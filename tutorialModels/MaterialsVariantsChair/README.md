## Description

This model uses the KHR_materials_variants extension. It is a chair with two possible fabric colors and two possible wood colors. There are a total of 4 variants.

If each variant was a separate model, they would be 1.8 MB each. Combined they make up a single model that is 1.8MB since they share geometry and textures, and differ only in baseColorFactor.
